# LED Blink using Atmega8

This is my first embedded systems project using the Atmega8 microcontroller and Proteus simulation.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- MPLAB X IDE
- Proteus 8 Professional
- Embedded C (AVR)

## ⚙️ Project Description
The project demonstrates how to blink an LED using an Atmega8 microcontroller.  
The LED is connected to one of the PORTB pins and toggles with a small delay.

## 📁 Files Included
- `main.c` → Source code for LED blinking
- `LED_Blink.pdsprj` → Proteus simulation file
- `LED_Blink.hex` → Compiled output file

## 🖼️ Output
In Proteus, the LED will blink continuously at regular intervals.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add button-controlled blinking  
- Add multiple LEDs with pattern control  
- Display status on 16x2 LCD
